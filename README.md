**Comments:**

1. I would try making adding the job title in the card that displays after clicking on one of the cards.
2. This is just being nit picky, but on the title of the home screen make sure to put "I'm" instead of "Im"
3. I really like how you were able to navigate your site using <\Suspense><\/Suspense>. I will be saving your code and review the steps, so I can try doing it myself.
